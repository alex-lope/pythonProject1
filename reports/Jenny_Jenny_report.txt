    Input Text: Dr. Judy, &nbsp; A code of ethics provides a vision that all work towards in achievement of the greater good for orginiazation (Verbos, Gerard, Forshey, Harding, and Miller, 2007). The code of ethics for Educators for the Association of American Educators created to enforce guidelines for teachers to create a nurturing environment for students to reach full potential. There are four main principles each explaining the responsibly of professional educators. Ethical conduct towards students states that educators personally accepts responsibility to teach students character qualities that will be useful in evaluating consequences along with the ability to accept their actions (Association of American Educators, 2015). Ethical conduct towards professional colleagues enforces educators to engage in ethical relationships with fellow colleagues. &nbsp;Ethical conduct toward practices andperformance states that all educators assume the responsibility and accountability for personal performance, striving to demonstrate competence. &nbsp;Ethical conduct towards parents and community explains the pledge that educators take to protect sovereignty over public education (Association of American Educators, 2015). The strengths of thesecodes are that they take into consideration the educator's personal leadership qualities, setting good examples, remaining professional at all times while being a part of the community.
