    Input Text: What I recollect from LDR 800 Ethical Dilemmas and Stewardship was understanding if and what the difference between ethical and moral behaviors. At the end of the course, I understood that our behaviors, decision and lifestyle should reflect our core values. Johnson described ethics as judgments about behaviors, but morals are like the Golden Rule (2015) of personal behaviors. So, depending on the situation they may be interchangeable, but they are not synonyms. I would suggest the word ethics has become prevalent because of the increased in visibility of numerous leaders and organizations that have behaved unethical or immoral and have been reported, caught and or charged. Ethical behavior in research can be biased and unbiased. It is the role of the researcher to maintain integrity throughout the research study, to be transparent and objective ((McClendon &amp; Elsasser, 2015). Ethics is not only knowing right from wrong but behaving in such a manner that those you influence will also project similar ethical behaviors and decisions (Johnson, 2015). Ethical behaviors are causal relationships (Barry, Lindauer, &amp; Overland, 2014) learned from socialization and familiar upbringing. Which is transferable during every stage of the research process (McClendon &amp; Elsasser, 2015). Ethical behaviors are determined by the individual but influenced by whomever socialized you but as you grow and develop, intermingle with other individuals; thus, self-reflection throughout the process is vital. My greatest concern is obtaining honest feedback without transferring my zeal for positive results to influence participants responses. The text provided the parameters for sample size but also explain how fluid it maybe for qualitative studies but doesn't answer what is considered too many.
